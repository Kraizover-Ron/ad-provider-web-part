# CookieClicker — Android App + Engagement SDK + Admin Dashboard

A small end-to-end project that connects an **Android app** to a **backend API**, and exposes an **Admin Dashboard** for monitoring users, sessions, clicks, ad eligibility, and ad serving.

## Demo

A quick demo showing the full flow: **taps → eligibility → ad → cooldown → score**.

## Project structure

- **`CookieClickerApp/`** — Android app (Kotlin)
  - includes **`engagementsdk`** module (a reusable mini-SDK)
- **`cookieclicker-server/`** — Node.js (Express) backend + Firebase Realtime Database
- **`cookieclicker-dashboard-react/`** — React + Vite + Tailwind admin dashboard

## How it works

### Core concepts (short explanations)

- **Session**: a play session started when the app comes to foreground and ended when it stops.
- **Events**: user activity sent to the server (mainly `click`, but also `screen_view`).
- **Eligibility**: a temporary state where the user is allowed to receive an ad.
- **Cooldown**: a waiting period after an ad is served, during which the user cannot receive another ad.

### Flow in this project

1. The Android app starts a **session** (`/v1/session/start`).
2. Every tap calls `EngagementSdk.trackClick()`.
3. The SDK batches events and sends them to the backend (`/v1/events/batch`).
4. The backend maintains **recent clicks** per user and checks whether the user reached the threshold:
   - default window: **10 seconds**
   - default threshold: **20 clicks**
5. When the threshold is reached, the backend marks the user as **eligible** for a short period (TTL).
6. The SDK/UI shows **“Eligible”**, then requests the next ad (`/v1/ads/next`).
7. If the user is eligible, the backend returns a demo ad payload and immediately starts a **cooldown** (and clears `recentClicks`).

**Default timings (server-side):**
- Click window: **10s**
- Threshold: **20 clicks**
- Eligibility TTL: **3 minutes**
- Cooldown: **3 minutes**

## Admin Dashboard

The dashboard is a lightweight web UI that reads **admin endpoints** from the backend.

### Overview page

- Total users / sessions / events
- How many users are **eligible now** vs **in cooldown**
- Ads served (total + last 24h)
- Charts (per minute): **clicks** and **ads served**
- Auto refresh (every ~5 seconds)

### Users page

- Search users by **userId / name / device**
- Table with:
  - sessions, clicks, avg session duration
  - eligibility state and cooldown state
  - ads served count, last ad served time, last seen time
- Click a user row to expand a per-user analytics card:
  - sessions/clicks/ads in the selected range
  - charts: clicks per minute + ads per minute
- Auto refresh (every ~5 seconds)

## API quick reference

### Public (used by the Android SDK)

- `GET /health` — health check
- `POST /v1/session/start` — start a session
- `POST /v1/session/end` — end a session
- `POST /v1/events/batch` — send events (clicks are counted here)
- `POST /v1/engagement/evaluate` — server-side eligibility evaluation (throttled by the SDK)
- `GET /v1/engagement/status?userId=...` — eligibility status
- `GET /v1/ads/next?userId=...` — returns **204** if not eligible, otherwise returns an ad and starts cooldown

### Admin (used by the Dashboard)

> If `ADMIN_KEY` is set in the server, the dashboard must send it as `X-ADMIN-KEY`.

- `GET /admin/overview`
- `GET /admin/users`
- `GET /admin/charts/clicks?range=hour|day|week`
- `GET /admin/charts/ads?range=hour|day|week`
- `GET /admin/users/:userId/metrics?range=hour|day|week`
- `GET /admin/users/:userId/charts/clicks?range=hour|day|week`
- `GET /admin/users/:userId/charts/ads?range=hour|day|week`
